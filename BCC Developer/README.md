# File Organizer Source Code for BCC Developer

**English** / [日本語](README-JA.md)

This source code is for **Windows PC**.

## Requirements

This project is for **BCC Developer** with **Borland C++ Compiler 5.5**. You probably need to modify the Include Path in "**Project Settings->Resources**" to reflect your environment.

## Notes

The source code is `1.cpp`, the resource script is `resource.rc`, and the icon is `app.ico`. You can edit and build this software by opening `FileSeparation.bdp` in BCC Developer. Do NOT put this folder on a path that includes non-ASCII characters.

The executable binary file will be generated as `FileSeparation.exe` in the `Debug` folder for debug builds, and the `Release` folder for release builds.
